I've never used github before. I'm not sure I've done this correctly. ><

Me rambling about my idea:
You make up quarks and down quarks in order to make protons and neutrons, you can spend up quarks and down quarks on generators for them to be produced automatically and once you have enough quark generators you can start making protons and neutron generators too, making sure to keep your quark production rates high enough to maintain the proton and neutron production. This concept continues upwards with as many layers and feasible. For now I have planned particles -> atoms -> molecules, after that it's a little up in the air but I hope to have macromolecules -> life (perhaps with stages in between, or other stages after molecules/macromelecules but at the same time as life, for solid matter and maybe energy or something like that.

After life I wanted the layers to continue perhaps with feudalism (like making barracks and castles and stuff) to globalization (making businesses or something) colonization of outer space, and then something involving the creation/destruction of the universe in the last layer that lets you rebirth.

So its like:
particles -> atoms -> molecules -> macromolecules -> organic matter -> lifeforms -> early society -> feudalism -> etc						  
Functions needed in the game are generators for everything, one or preferably a few upgrades for everythings generators, and then a bunch of universal upgrades that increase production and provide other features to gameplay, like better monitoring of statistics and easier production of large amounts of items. Also a scoring and/or levelling system that works with an unlocking system so that you progress through the game, playing a few layers at once and and designed so that you "complete" the first few layers after your production of a resource reaches such a point that you are able to afford an upgrade that automates the production of the first layer to allow you to focus on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th, another upgrade to automate the second.

I'm going to try to summarize this and do up a list of planned or considered content, the game is going to be open source and anybody that wishes to help can be compensated if the game ever generates some form of revenue, perhaps through an ad.

Of course, if you just suggest a change to the code, I'm not going to pay you, but if you like the idea and want to actually work on the game I am happy to give credit where it is due and feature you in the credits as well as share a percentage of any revenue generated after costs that may be incurred from hosting the game. Ideally I want to receive on a small percentage of revenue for the game (perhaps 10%) and share the other 90% with more proficient coders and artists, with my focus being on gameplay mechanics and testing and feedback.

Of course if nobody is interested and nobody ends up helping with me I will slowly plod my way through development over the next few years and hopefully learn enough to produce a playable, interesting and educational game in the long run.
